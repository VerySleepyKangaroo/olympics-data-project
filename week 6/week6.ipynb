    "**Purpose Statement:** This project aims to investigate how the average age of gold medalists in athletics events has changed over the past five Summer Olympic Games. By analyzing athlete data by event, year, and age, the study seeks to uncover whether there is a trend toward younger or older champions in Olympic-level athletics. This exploration will also consider potential factors influencing these shifts, such as advancements in sports science, training longevity, and evolving event specialization. The findings may help identify age-related performance patterns and inform future coaching and development strategies.\n",
