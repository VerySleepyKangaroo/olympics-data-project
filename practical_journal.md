## Reflection:

- What’s one thing you learned about the Olympics dataset?
    - There are people from many different ages such as kids that are 10 years old and older people that are 97 years old that partake in the Olympics
- What did you find challenging in setting up or running Pandas?
    - I found challenges in running pandas as there are requirements that are needed to run pandas. An example for one of my challenegs was that the code should not be in a sub-repo as well as the .csv file.
- What’s something you'd like to analyse next?
    - I would like to analyse a file that has a lot of data as understanding it would be more of a challenge, a challenge that I would like.
